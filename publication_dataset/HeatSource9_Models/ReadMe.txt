---MODEL INFORMATION---

July_baseline: Heat Source 9 temperature model representing the observed vegetation conditions and stream width in the West Fork of the Kickapoo River. 

July_baseline_extended: Heat Source 9 temperature model representing the observed vegetation conditions and stream width in the West Fork of the Kickapoo River. Model is extended 5km past the downstream boundary of the July_baseline model.

July_allforest_extended: Heat Source 9 temperature model representing the replacement existing riparian vegetation with a forested buffer and widening the channel 20% in previously non-forest areas. Model is extended 5km past the downstream boundary of the July_baseline model.

July_allgrass_extended: Heat Source 9 temperature model representing the replacement existing riparian vegetation with a grass buffer and narrowing the channel 20% in previously forested areas. Model is extended 5km past the downstream boundary of the July_baseline model.
